Working on overall rework of the scripts to:
    1. make code compatible with PowerShell Core v7
    2. make use of my module sbourdeaud in PowerShell Gallery in order to facilitate future maintenance
    3. re-organize files and file away archived scripts (no longer maintained scripts) and work in progress (wip)

Please report any bugs here.
